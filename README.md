# Dotfiles

Delete your old .vimrc (and bundles and local and whatever) 

Delete your old .zshrc and .zsh folder (and whatever else)

Symlink these files to your root.

Open up the `.vimrc.bundles` and do `:PlugInstall` to install them

# Antigen

If you're missing `antigen.zsh` use the following command to get it : `curl -L git.io/antigen > antigen.zsh`.
